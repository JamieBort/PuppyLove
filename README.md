TODO:

A completed commit was pushed. However I need to revisit this to address the following:

- [ ] 1. Make this match the markup image. (I am 98% done)
- [ ] 2. Make this look appropriate on tablets and mobile devices. To do this Chrome's dev tools.
- [ ] 3. Clean up tags (id and class) so the css consists of as few of lines of code as necessary.
- [ ] 4. Remove 'old' directory.
- [ ] 5. Make gh-pages branch (or gh_pages branch).
- [ ] 6. Push to gh-pages.

Your task is to review index.png and index.html and to write the CSS to match the mockup listed below.

Getting Started

Inside, you'll find a resources folder and a starter_files folder. The resources folder contains the screenshot of the final HTML page, but you can just use the one below.

The starter_files folder contains the starter HTML file, the img folder (containing all of the images for the page), and a blank CSS file. The CSS file is already linked up to the HTML file, so you can go ahead and code away with your styles.
